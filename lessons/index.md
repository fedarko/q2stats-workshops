# What is the purpose of these notes?
These notes are designed to serve as a platform to better understand underlying statistical concepts. Here, we will discuss some of the caveats behind beta-diversity, differential abundance in addition to some emerging ideas on how to perform multiomics analyses (with an emphasis on microbe-metabolite interactions).

# What are the prerequisites?
These notes already assume that you have some background knowledge in qiime2.
This includes understanding
 - How microbial features are determined - either through closed reference OTU-picking or denoising techniques such as DADA2 and Deblur.
 - Some background in alpha and beta-diversity analyses
 - Taxonomy assignment
